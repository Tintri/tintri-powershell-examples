## Tintri Automation Toolkit for PowerShell - Examples  ##

The Tintri Automation Toolkit is a set of PowerShell cmdlets that help automate Tintri management tasks like per-VM snapshots, replication, cloning, viewing per-VM and vDisk statistics and appliance configuration. The toolkit works with both Tintri VMstore and Tintri Global Center and offers integration with VMware PowerCLI and Microsoft Hyper-V Manager cmdlets.
